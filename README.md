This project is a real-time data dashboard built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides users with an interactive interface to monitor, visualize, and filter data. The app includes various components for user authentication, profile management, dynamic filtering, and interactive charts.

Features
User Authentication: A secure login page for authenticating users.
Profile Management: A settings page where users can manage their profiles and preferences.
Data Visualization: Interactive charts that display data dynamically.
Custom Tooltips: Provides additional data insights when users hover over chart data points.
Filters and Toggles: Allows users to apply dynamic filters and toggles to customize the data displayed.
Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS, the app is fully responsive across all devices.
Static Login Credentials
For testing purposes, the application comes with static login credentials:

Username: admin
Password: password123
You can use these credentials to access the dashboard during development.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and ensures a mobile-first, responsive design.
Charting Library: (likely Recharts or Chart.js) used to render interactive data visualizations.
React Hooks: Managing component state and lifecycle methods using modern React practices.
